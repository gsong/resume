## Experience

### [Dequency]: <small style="font-size:.7em;">Head of Engineering, Jun 2022–Jul 2023</small>

At Dequency, I took charge of the external agency-built v2 platform. V2 presented challenges hindering rapid iterations:

- Complex abstractions reminiscent of Java web apps.
- Tight coupling of front-end features across user roles.
- Mismatched domain and schema models.
- Prevalence of elusive bugs.
- Unreliable and sluggish continuous integration and deployment.

I led the transition to in-house maintenance of v2 while making the bold call to reconstruct the platform. In just 8 months with a compact team, I achieved both feats. The new platform seamlessly supplanted v2, addressing all deficiencies and introducing previously difficult-to-develop features:

- Integrated AI music analysis engine, significantly enhancing discovery.
- Introduced Stripe payment integration, welcoming non-crypto users.
- Implemented a custom license feature, unveiling new business opportunities.

Our teams swiftly developed proof-of-concept apps (e.g., one for Twitter in a week), cut deployment time by 70%, reduced hosting expenses by 95%, and notably boosted developer productivity and morale.
